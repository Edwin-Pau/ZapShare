<b>Our Story and Mission</b>

What is ZapShare all about?
We believe we can change the world for the better by increasing the adoption of electric vehicles in our cities.
We understand the pain points of owning an electric vehicle; we are building techonology that improves the user experience.
We believe in a peer-to-peer network system, where our users can engage directly with other electric vehicle owners.
